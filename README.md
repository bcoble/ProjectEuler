Project Euler Solutions
----------
Author: Ben Coble
==========

These are my solutions to problems on Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net)

The purpose of my publication of these solutions is to provide a sample
of my coding ability. I enjoy these puzzles and the challenge of solving them.
If you are interested in trying these problems, DO NOT LOOK AT MY SOLUTIONS. 
You will be depriving yourself of the satisfaction of solving them yourself. 

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at ben.j.coble@gmail.com.

Thanks!
